	Social Network Analysis project on Covid-19 cases over the entire Indian subcontinent

Topic: Understanding the concept of Diffusion on COVID-19 virus on India

This project proposes a technique to visualize a spread of Covid-19 corona virus in the Indian subcontinent and analyse the data collected from a reputed data source. It also aims to further propose new ideas in studying future pandemics and spread of viruses and biological diseases.
New data is created everyday on Covid-19 but no proper method has been created to visualize the spread and understand this pandemic. This project proposes to provide an insight into the spread of the above-mentioned virus right from the beginning of the year, i.e. January, 2020 up to the present day in April, 2020 via live data collected from reliable source.
We will gradually see how the virus started from the state of Kerala and spread across the subcontinent within weeks. Concepts of diffusion will be explained through visualisations over the datasets. Various tools like Social Network Visualizer and the Python programming language has been used to proceed with this project.

The data has been collected from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/imdevskp/covid19-corona-virus-india-dataset

Languages and softwares used:
